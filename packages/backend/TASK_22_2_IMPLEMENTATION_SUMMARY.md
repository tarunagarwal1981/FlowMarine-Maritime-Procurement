   - Automatic interval clearing on disconnection
   - Memory leak prevention

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### WebSocket Server Configuration
```typescript
// Connection path: /socket.io/dashboard
// Authentication: JWT token-based
// Rooms: user-specific, vessel-specific, role-based
```

- **Permissions**: Granular permission validation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Dashboard-specific rate limits (30 requests/minute)

### üìà Performance Metrics

The service provides comprehensive performance monitoring:

```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  subscriptions: {
    total: number;
    byType: Record<string, number>;
    byDataType: Record<string, number>;
  };
  connections: {
    active: number;
    rooms: number;
  };
  changeListeners: {
    active: number;
    types: string[];
  };
  memory: {
    subscriptionsMapSize: number;
    updateIntervalsMapSize: number;
    changeListenersMapSize: number;
  };
}
```

### üåê WebSocket Events

#### Client to Server
- `subscribe_dashboard`: Subscribe to dashboard updates
- `unsubscribe_dashboard`: Unsubscribe from updates
- `update_dashboard_filters`: Update subscription filters
