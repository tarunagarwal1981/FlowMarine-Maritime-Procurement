# Task 17.1 Advanced Security Implementation - Validation

## Implementation Summary

This document validates the implementation of Task 17.1: Advanced Security Implementation, which includes:

1. ✅ **Field-level encryption for sensitive banking data**
2. ✅ **Comprehensive audit logging for all user actions**
3. ✅ **Security incident detection and alerting system**
4. ✅ **Data retention policies with automatic archival**

## 1. Field-Level Encryption Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/services/fieldEncryptionService.ts` - Complete implementation
- `src/test/securityHardening.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests

### Key Features:
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption for maximum security
- ✅ Separate IV and authentication tag for each field
- ✅ Specialized banking data encryption methods
- ✅ Validation and comparison utilities
- ✅ Error handling and logging

### Security Measures:
- Uses environment variable `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for key derivation
- Implements authenticated encryption (GCM mode)
- Generates unique IV for each encryption operation
- Includes authentication tag to prevent tampering
- Logs all encryption/decryption operations

### Banking Data Protection:
```typescript
// Example usage:
const bankingData = {
  accountNumber: '123456789',
  routingNumber: '987654321',
  swiftCode: 'ABCDUS33',
  iban: 'GB82WEST12345698765432'
};

const encrypted = fieldEncryptionService.encryptBankingData(bankingData);
// Each field is individually encrypted with unique IV and tag
```

## 2. Comprehensive Audit Logging

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/services/auditService.ts` - Enhanced with security features
- `src/middleware/auditLogger.ts` - Existing middleware integration

### Key Features:
- ✅ Enhanced audit log entries with severity and category
- ✅ Security incident detection from audit patterns
- ✅ Specialized logging methods for different data types
- ✅ Advanced filtering and querying capabilities
- ✅ Real-time security monitoring

### Audit Categories:
- `AUTHENTICATION` - Login/logout events
- `AUTHORIZATION` - Permission checks
- `DATA_ACCESS` - Sensitive data access
- `DATA_MODIFICATION` - Create/update/delete operations
- `SECURITY` - Security-related events
- `COMPLIANCE` - Regulatory compliance events
- `SYSTEM` - System operations

### Severity Levels:
- `CRITICAL` - Emergency overrides, data breaches
- `HIGH` - Login attempts, access denials, exports
- `MEDIUM` - Updates, creates, approvals
- `LOW` - General system operations

### Specialized Logging Methods:
```typescript
// Banking data access logging
await AuditService.logBankingDataAccess({
  userId: 'user123',
  vendorId: 'vendor456',
  action: 'decrypt',
  fields: ['accountNumber', 'swiftCode'],
  ipAddress: '192.168.1.100'
});

// Compliance event logging
await AuditService.logComplianceEvent({
  regulation: 'SOLAS Chapter IX',
  complianceType: 'SOLAS',
  action: 'CERTIFICATE_RENEWAL',
  vesselId: 'vessel789'
});
```

- `AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE` - Multiple failed logins
- `PERMISSION_VIOLATION` - Privilege escalation attempts
- `MALWARE_DETECTED` - Security software alerts
- `INSIDER_THREAT` - Internal security risks

### Detection Patterns:
1. **Multiple Failed Logins** (Risk Score: 75)
   - 5+ failed attempts in 60 minutes
   - Automatic account lockout for high-risk cases

2. **Unusual Data Access** (Risk Score: 80)
   - 10+ sensitive data accesses
   - Off-hours access patterns

3. **Privilege Escalation** (Risk Score: 85)
   - 3+ permission denials
   - Role change attempts

4. **Bulk Data Export** (Risk Score: 95)
   - 100MB+ export volume
   - 5+ export operations

### Alert Channels:
- `EMAIL` - For high/critical incidents
- `SMS` - For critical incidents
- `WEBHOOK` - For external system integration
- `DASHBOARD` - Real-time UI notifications

### Auto-Mitigation:
- Account locking for authentication failures (risk > 80)
- User suspension for suspicious activity (risk > 90)
- Manual intervention required for data breaches

## 4. Data Retention Policies with Automatic Archival

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/services/dataRetentionService.ts` - Complete implementation
- Database migration with retention policy tables

### Key Features:
- ✅ Configurable retention policies per resource type
- ✅ Maritime compliance requirements (7-10 years)
- ✅ Automatic archival before deletion
- ✅ Legal hold management
- ✅ Scheduled execution

### Retention Policies:
```typescript
// Maritime compliance requirements
'audit_logs': 2555 days (7 years) - SOLAS/ISM
'requisitions': 2555 days (7 years) - Maritime Safety
'purchase_orders': 2555 days (7 years) - Financial Records
'invoices': 2555 days (7 years) - Tax/Financial
'security_incidents': 3650 days (10 years) - Security Compliance
'banking_data': 2555 days (7 years) - Financial/PCI + Legal Hold
'user_sessions': 90 days (3 months)
'refresh_tokens': 30 days (1 month)
'notifications': 365 days (1 year)
```

### Legal Hold Management:
