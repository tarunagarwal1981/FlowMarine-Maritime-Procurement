- **Excel**: Multi-worksheet exports with proper formatting
- **CSV**: Raw data export for external analysis

**Template System:**
- Custom layouts with configurable sections
- Branding and styling customization
- Permission-based template access
- Default templates for each dashboard type

### API Integration

**Controller:** `src/controllers/dashboardController.ts`
**Routes:** `src/routes/dashboardRoutes.ts`

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/dashboard/export/pdf` - Export to PDF
- `POST /api/dashboard/export/excel` - Export to Excel
- `POST /api/dashboard/templates` - Create export template
- `POST /api/dashboard/schedule-report` - Schedule automated report
- `GET /api/dashboard/export-job/:jobId` - Get export job status
- `GET /api/dashboard/subscription-stats` - WebSocket statistics

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token validation for all connections and requests
- Role-based access control for different data types
- Vessel-specific access validation
- Permission-based data filtering

### Rate Limiting
- Dashboard-specific rate limits (30 requests/minute)
- Adaptive rate limiting based on user role
- Connection-based throttling for WebSocket

### Audit Logging
- All dashboard access and export operations logged
- Subscription events tracked with user accountability
- Security incidents recorded and monitored
- Export operations audited with file size and success status

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- Analytics data cached for 15 minutes
- Subscription state cached in memory
- Change detection optimized with timestamps
- Selective data updates to minimize bandwidth

### Connection Management
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected subscriptions
- Efficient room-based broadcasting
- Connection pooling and reuse
- Graceful degradation on high load

### Data Processing
- Parallel data generation for multiple analytics types
- Promise.allSettled for graceful partial failure handling
- Background data pre-aggregation
- Intelligent change detection to avoid unnecessary updates

## Integration Points

### Existing Services Integration
- Seamless integration with `DashboardAnalyticsService`
- Shared caching layer with `CacheService`
- Audit logging through `AuditService`
- User authentication via existing middleware

### Database Integration
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Change detection through timestamp monitoring
- User permission validation

## Monitoring & Diagnostics

### Health Checks
- Service health endpoint: `/api/dashboard/health`
- Connection statistics tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring

### Statistics Available
```typescript
interface SubscriptionStatistics {
  totalSubscriptions: number;
  connectedUsers: number;
  subscriptionsByType: Record<string, number>;
  dataTypeUsage: Record<string, number>;
}
```

### Real-time Metrics
- Active WebSocket connections
- Subscription counts by dashboard type
- Data type usage patterns
- Export job success rates

## Error Handling & Resilience

### Connection Errors
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation on service unavailability
- Client-side error recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive error logging

### Data Processing Errors
- Partial failure handling for analytics generation
- Fallback to cached data when possible
- Error notifications to affected subscribers
- Detailed error reporting for debugging

### Export Errors
- Permission validation before processing
- File size limits and validation
- Graceful handling of template errors
- Audit logging of failed operations

## Usage Examples

### WebSocket Client Connection
```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
  path: '/socket.io/dashboard',
  auth: { token: 'your-jwt-token' }
});

socket.emit('subscribe_dashboard', {
  dashboardType: 'executive',
  dataTypes: ['spend_analytics', 'budget_utilization'],
  filters: {
    startDate: '2024-01-01',
    endDate: '2024-12-31',
