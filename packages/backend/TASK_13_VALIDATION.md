   - Exact quantity matching with exception handling
   - Invoice validation against purchase orders and receipts
   - Automatic status updates based on validation results

3. **Invoice Controller** (`src/controllers/invoiceController.ts`)
   - RESTful API endpoints for invoice management
   - File upload handling for OCR processing

   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **Invoice Routes** (`src/routes/invoiceRoutes.ts`)
   - Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization
   - Role-based access control
   - Rate limiting and audit logging

#### Key Features:
- ✅ OCR processing with confidence scoring
- ✅ Three-way matching (PO, Receipt, Invoice)
- ✅ ±2% price tolerance validation
- ✅ Exact quantity matching
- ✅ Exception handling for mismatches
- ✅ Automatic invoice status updates
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

### 13.2 Payment Processing Integration ✅ COMPLETED

#### Components Implemented:
1. **Payment Service** (`src/services/paymentService.ts`)
   - Banking system integration simulation
   - Multi-level approval workflows
   - Payment exception handling
   - Audit trail generation

2. **Payment Controller** (`src/controllers/paymentController.ts`)
   - Payment initiation with security controls
   - Approval workflow management
   - Payment status tracking
   - Exception handling and manual review processes

3. **Payment Routes** (`src/routes/paymentRoutes.ts`)
   - IP-restricted financial operations
   - Role-based payment approvals
   - Comprehensive security middleware

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Banking system integration framework
- ✅ Multi-level approval workflows based on amount thresholds
- ✅ Payment exception handling and manual review
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trails
- ✅ Security controls with IP restrictions
- ✅ Payment status tracking and history

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Uses existing Prisma schema with Invoice model
- Stores OCR data as JSON in `ocrData` field
- Stores matching results in `matchingResults` field
- Maintains payment status and audit information

### Security Features
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- Role-based authorization (FINANCE_TEAM, PROCUREMENT_MANAGER, ADMIN)
- Vessel access control validation
- IP restrictions for financial operations
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

### Error Handling
- Custom error classes with specific error codes
- Graceful handling of OCR failures
- Banking system timeout and error recovery
- Validation error reporting
- Exception logging and alerting

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suites for both services
- Unit tests for three-way matching logic
- Payment workflow testing
- Error condition testing
- Mock banking integration testing

## API Endpoints

### Invoice Processing
- `POST /api/invoices` - Create invoice
- `POST /api/invoices/:id/process-ocr` - Process invoice with OCR
- `POST /api/invoices/:id/three-way-match` - Perform three-way matching
- `GET /api/invoices/:id/status` - Get processing status
- `GET /api/invoices` - List invoices with filtering
- `PATCH /api/invoices/:id/status` - Update invoice status

### Payment Processing
- `POST /api/payments/initiate` - Initiate payment
- `POST /api/payments/:invoiceId/approve` - Approve payment
- `GET /api/payments/:invoiceId/status` - Get payment status
- `POST /api/payments/:invoiceId/exception` - Handle payment exception
- `GET /api/payments/history` - Get payment history
- `GET /api/payments/pending` - Get pending payments
